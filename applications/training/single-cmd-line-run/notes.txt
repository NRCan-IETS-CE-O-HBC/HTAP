TRAINING NOTES:

1) single-cmd-line run
======================

*** commands: 

cd C:\HTAP\applications\training\single-cmd-line-run
C:\HTAP\substitute-h2k.rb -c .\HOT2000.choices -o .\HOT2000.options  -v


a) Run command. Talk about what is happening. 

    [ substitute-h2k is reading the specifications in the .choice file, and 
      for each choice, the associated parameters from the options file. 
      Based on that data, substitute-h2k.rb will: \
        - open a hot2000 file, 
        - manipulate it to match the specifications from the .choice file,
        - invoke hot2000 to evaluate energy use 
        - parse hot2000 output.
        - write out results.
        
      Note that results are shown on screen. They are also written to:
        - a token-value file. 
        - the browse.rpt file in the sim-output directory
        - the modified .h2k file 
    
    ]

b) Open up the choice file - Look at contents 

    [ - Choice file is in token-value format and is used to spec how 
        a hot2000 file should be modified and invoked for the simulation.
     
      - Some choices define how hot2000 should be invoked (archetype, result
        mode) while others define how a .h2k file should be modified. 
        
    ]
       
c) Open up the options file - look at contents        

    [ - The .options file defines the valid choices that can be set 
        for each parameter, and also contain info that substitute-h2k
        uses to determine how the .h2k file should be modified accordingly
        
      - Note that there is info in the .options file that pretains to 
        an earlier ESP-r implementaiton - not all of the data is relevant
        to hot2000. The best (not very good) way to determine which 
        is which ? Look at the tags at the top of an options definition.
        
d) Talk about defaults: Not all of the options need to be set in the 
   .choice file. If an option is ommitted, substitute-h2k will attempt   
   to use the default.    
   
   
e) Talk about NA - 

    [ Throughout HTAP, "NA" is used as a code for 'leave the file alone' 
 
      Whatever parameters exist in the original file will be left 
      in the HTAP run

    ]

    
f) Change some parameters in the .choice file:

    [ Substitute : 
    
         Opt-Archetype : SmallSFD  to LargeSFD
         
         Opt-Location  : NA        to Calgary

         Opt-ACH       : NA        to ACH_0_6
         
          
    ]
    
    
g) Demonstrate a typical error - misspell Calggary
