INSTALLING HTAP
---------------

1. Required software

   HTAP depends on the following third-party components:
   
   • Ruby: http://rubyinstaller.org/ 
   • Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads  
   
   In addition to these, you may find the following tools useful: 
   
   • A text file editor, such as notepad++
   • A data analysis program, such as Matlab, tableau or excel. 


2. Installation
 
   
    HTAP consists of two parts:
    i)  HOT2000 v11.3 (including command-line client) 
    ii) HTAP scripts and configuration files. 

    a) To download HOT2000 v11.3, visit https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DY1Oae9-d9U8U-jxvRBB54EUM8Df8y-u , 
       and install these files in the following order:
       1. vc_redist.x86.exe (install this one first)
       2. HOT2000 v11.3b90 Setup.exe (if you don't already have it)
       3. HOT2000-CLI Setup.exe - When prompted, set the destination location to C:\H2K-CLI-Min 

    b) To Install the HTAP scripts and configuration files, checkout the files from GitHub:
    
        C:\> git clone https://github.com/NRCan-IETS-CE-O-HBC/HTAP.git
    
    c)	Before you can run HTAP simulations, you must first copy the archetype files to the 
        C:\H2K-CLI-Min\User\ directory. HTAP includes a ruby script to do this for you:

           PS C:\> cd .\HTAP\Archetypes
           PS C:\HTAP\Archetypes> ruby .\CopyToH2K.rb
